# MM2RunningAverageTracker
My quick program I made that is used occasionally on my stream (twitch.tv/dsteves) which keeps track of the most recent progress made. When the "comma" button is pressed, it updates the program accordingly.

Using JNativeHook, you can read background input from your keyboard while you are tabbed out of your IDE. Necessary so I can run Streamlabs OBS in the foreground while having this program run simultaneously.
